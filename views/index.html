      A Saga pattern is a way of representing a long-running transaction. What
      we do is we have multiple requests, managed by a saga. These requests can
      be run in sequence or in parallel. When all the requests are complete and
      have all completed successfully then only we say that our saga is
      completed. But what happens if one request(R1) finished successfully but
      another request(R2) failed, what to do now? How to deal with this failure?
      The answer to that lies within the implementation of the saga pattern. So
      what happens is, in saga each request is paired up with a compensating
      action. If a request fails compensating actions are executed for all the
      completed steps in that request. Once such a scenario occurs we do not
      complete the saga, instead, we fail the saga, and if the compensating
      action also failed then we retry the compensating action till the time it
      succeeds. (Src: https://blog.knoldus.com)
